# Maximum-height-coin
Python Program for Maximum height when coins are arranged in a triangle
We have N coins which need to arrange in form of a triangle, i.e. first row will have 1 coin, second row will have 2 coins and so on, we need to tell maximum height which we can achieve by using these N coins.

Examples:

Input : N = 7
Output : 3
Maximum height will be 3, putting 1, 2 and
then 3 coins. It is not possible to use 1 
coin left.

Input : N = 12
Output : 4
Maximum height will be 4, putting 1, 2, 3 and 
4 coins, it is not possible to make height as 5, 
because that will require 15 coins.
